*Weltschmerz* is a short doc (2017).

While the world is ablaze, a blind director asks her theater group to help her process her broken heart. In a chaotic and iconographic role play, the group embarks on its search for love's true nature, while the fear of the physical world's limitations are buried deep underneath the stage floor.
